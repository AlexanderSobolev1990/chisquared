# CHI SQUARED APPROXIMATIONS #

## 1. Brief ##
<br/> Different approximations of the chi-square distribution law with N degrees of freedom.
<br/>	- Canal approximation;
<br/>	- Kelley approximation;
<br/>	- Peizer-Pratt approximation;
<br/>	- Polynomial approximation (only for 3 degrees of freedom!);

<br/> Probably Peizer-Pratt and Polynomial approximation give best results.

## 2. Notes ##
<br/> Results are calculated for 3 degrees of freedom.
<br/> Use gnuplot to plot results to comparison graph:
<br/> Copy plot1, plot2 gnuplot scripts to destination directory and run from terminal:
<br/> gnuplot -persist plot1
<br/> gnuplot -persist plot2
